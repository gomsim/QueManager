# QueManager

This is a simple program I made for the local student pub. Whenever food is ready they use to ring a bell and scream across the noisy crowd 
the number of the order, and people always need to walk to the bar to check if it was their number they heard of if they misstok it.
So I made this little program.

The program's sole purpose is to let the pub staff punch in the number of an order that is ready to be picked up, upon which a ticket is 
clearly shown on the top of the screen. When the order then is picked up the ticket can be removed.

The program is made to run mostly invisible on top of the desktop, becasue the pub has a screen, but it runs adds on it, so I thought, if 
the program is mostly transparent, the adds can run underneath while the ordering tickets only temporarily takes up a portion of the screen.

Several tickets lined up. Tickets exceeding five hide to the right of the screen until space is avalable.
